# ScratchPLEO
ScratchPLEO is a tool allowing PLEO dinosaur robots to be programmed using the Scratch programming language

ScratchPLEO is almost complete, however to solve some ambiguities in the official Pleo Development Kit, it was deceided that ScratchPLEO would use [OpenPDK](https://github.com/garethnelson/openpdk), which is not yet complete. Work is now being focused on completing OpenPDK to a level that ScrachPLEO can be used, at which point the final changes to ScratchPLEO will be made.
